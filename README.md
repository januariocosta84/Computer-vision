Sign Language Interpreter using Computer Vision
Objective
The objective of this code is to develop a Sign Language Interpreter using computer vision techniques. The goal is to provide a solution for people who are deaf or have hearing impairments, allowing them to communicate more effectively by interpreting their sign language gestures.

Overview
This project utilizes computer vision algorithms and techniques to analyze and interpret the hand gestures commonly used in sign language. By capturing video input from a camera, the code detects and tracks the hand movements in real-time, converting them into meaningful text or spoken words.

Features
Real-time Hand Tracking: The code employs computer vision algorithms to track and detect hand movements in real-time, enabling accurate interpretation of sign language gestures.

Gesture Recognition: By analyzing the tracked hand movements, the code identifies and recognizes specific sign language gestures. It maps these gestures to their corresponding meanings using a predefined dictionary or dataset.

Text Output: The interpreted sign language gestures are converted into text, allowing the user to understand and communicate the intended message.
